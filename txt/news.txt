'They live in big fear': The BBC visits displaced Alawites in Lebanon
At least 6,000 Syrians are believed to have crossed into neighbouring Lebanon in the last few days to escape violence in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus.
The area is a stronghold of Syria's ousted former President, Bashar al-Assad, and hundreds of civilians have been killed there by the new government's security forces.
BBC Beirut correspondent Carine Torbey is in Tal el Bireh - an Alawite border village in Lebanon where Syrians have found shelter.

Watch: Aerial video shows extent of damage to North Sea oil tanker
Aerial video shows the extent of the damage to the US-registered Stena Immaculate oil tanker, almost 24 hours after it collided with a Portuguese-flagged container ship called the Solong.
The incident took place just off the coast of East Yorkshire. Both ships caught fire after the crash at about 10:00 GMT.
The coastguard said 36 people were brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalised.
Solong's owner, Ernst Russ, later shared that one member of its 14-strong crew was missing.

# A volcano near Alaska's largest city could erupt in the coming weeks or months, scientists say - The Associated Press

A volcano near Alaska’s largest city could erupt in the coming weeks or months, scientists say

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A volcano near Alaska’s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday that it had measured during recent overflights “significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,” and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.
“We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,” the observatory said in a statement. “Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.”
What is Mount Spurr?
It is an 11,070-foot (3,374-meter) tall, ice- and snow-covered volcano roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.
Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents.
When did Mount Spurr last erupt?
The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.
There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.
The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.
However, “It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,” John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.
What impacts could an eruption have?
The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.
In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.
Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.
The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.
Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren’t connected to Alaska’s main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world’s busiest cargo hubs.

# US says India imposes 150% tariff on alcohol and 100% on Agriculture products - Big News Network

US says India imposes 150% tariff on alcohol and 100% on Agriculture products
New Delhi [India], March 13 (ANI): White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, while lamenting the tariffs imposed by various nations on the United States, referred to the tariffs imposed by India on American alcohol and agricultural products.
'I have a handy dandy chart here that shows not just Canada but the rate of tariffs across the board. If you look at Canada, since you brought it up, American cheese and butter have a nearly 300 per cent tariff. You look at India, 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that's helping Kentucky bourbon be exported into India? I don't think so. 100 per cent tariff on agricultural products from India,' Leavitt said.
https://x.com/ANI/status/1899519902933028924
While addressing a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), she said that US President Donald Trump believes in reciprocity and wants to have fair and balanced trade practices.
The Press Secretary also accused Canada of 'ripping off' the US and Americans 'for decades' with its 'egregious' rate of tariffs.
Being asked about the timeline for Trump speaking to Canada's Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney, Leavitt responded, 'The president is again responding to the fact that Canada has been ripping off the United States of America and hardworking Americans for decades. If you look at the rates of tariffs across the board that Canadians have been imposing on the American people and our workers here, it is egregious.'
Leavitt further mentioned the tariffs imposed by India and Japan on different US products. She added that today the US has a President who 'actually looks out' for the interests of American businesses and workers.
'Look at Japan, tariffing rice, 700 per cent. President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about...time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers. And all he's asking for at the end of the day are fair and balanced trade practices and unfortunately, Canada has not been treating us very fairly at all over the past several decades,' she added.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that tariffs against neighbouring countries Mexico and Canada could go higher in the future, Fox News reported. He added that the global community has been ripping off the US for ages.
'I think [the business community could see clarity on tariffs],' he said, addressing CEOs' desire to see predictability for Capital Expenditure spending and shareholder purposes.
'But the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up...' he added, as per Fox News.'For years, globalists have been ripping off the United States. They've been taking money away from the United States, and all we're doing is getting some of it back, and we're going to treat our country fairly,' Fox News quoted Trump as saying.
Trump said that the US would get back at the other countries for the same, as per Fox News. 'This country has been ripped off from every nation in the world, every company in the world. We've been ripped off at levels never seen before, and what we're going to do is get it back,' he said.
Trump has imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, citing the countries' alleged border control issues leading to fentanyl pouring into the US and killing American citizens, Fox News reported.
Earlier on March 7, Trump delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a short-term period for certain products before the 'big one' from April 2. He said he agreed after having 'fruitful conversations' with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum while he slammed Canada for being a 'high tariff nation'.
Last week, Trump attacked India's tariffs, saying it is 'next to impossible to sell anything to India' because of the 'high tariffs.'
In a nationally televised address, Trump focused on the tariffs his administration will be putting in effect soon. However, he also revealed that India has agreed to slash its tariffs significantly, allegedly because 'somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.'
In his remarks at the White House, Trump stated, 'India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You can't even sell anything in India...They have agreed, by the way; they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.' (ANI)

A spokesperson for the United Kingdom’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency said Monday’s crash had occurred off the county of East Yorkshire.

Both the oil tanker and cargo vessel were on fire off the northeastern coast of England with British media showing images of a huge plume of black smoke and flames rising from the scene.
Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, said at least 32 casualties were brought ashore, but their conditions were not immediately clear.
“It’s too far out for us to see – about 10 miles [16km] – but we have seen the vessels bringing them in,” he said, reporting that 13 casualties were brought in on a Windcat 33 vessel, followed by another 19 on a harbour pilot boat.
Boyers said he had been told there was “a massive fireball”.
The coastguard agency sent a helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, lifeboats and vessels with fire-fighting capability to the busy stretch of waterway after the alarm was raised at 09:48 GMT.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which was working on the emergency response, said there were reports that “a number of people had abandoned the vessels”, which sparked “fires on both ships”.
It said three lifeboats were working on search and rescue at the scene alongside the coastguard.
Swedish tanker company Stena Bulk confirmed it owned the oil tanker involved in the accident, specifying that it was operated by Crowley, a United States-based maritime company.

Stena Bulk said the 20-person crew on board had been accounted for.
According to media reports, the cargo ship involved is named the Solong or So Long and is owned by the German company Reederei Koepping.
The area where the collision took place has traffic running from the ports along Britain’s northeast coast to the Netherlands and Germany.
The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations shipping agency, said it was aware of the situation and was checking further.

British Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced that NHS England would be scrapped in order to cut back on bureaucracy.
The announcement comes as the country's National Health Service (NHS), which provides free health care to almost the whole population, increasingly comes under fire for long waiting lists and a number of medical scandals.

What did Starmer say?
"Overstretched, unfocused, trying to do too much, doing it badly," Starmer said while on a visit to the eastern English city of Hull.
"I can't in all honesty explain to the British people why they should spend their money on two layers of bureaucracy. That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations, GP appointments," he said.
"So today, I can announce we're going to cut bureaucracy ... focus government on the priorities of working people, shift money to the front line."
"So I'm bringing management of the NHS back into democratic control by abolishing the arms-length body, NHS England."

‘A rain of rockets and bullets’: Survivors of Pakistan’s train hijacking
Dozens of separatist Baloch fighters attacked the Jaffar Express passenger train in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

By Saadullah Akhter
Published On 12 Mar 202512 Mar 2025
Quetta, Pakistan – Survivors of Tuesday’s deadly train hijacking by Baloch separatists have described how they watched fellow passengers being executed and fled while being shot at.
Dozens of fighters belonging to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted nine carriages of the Jaffar Express with rocket-propelled grenades and gunshots as it passed through colonial-era tunnels in the rugged, mountainous Bolan Pass.
The train, which departed from Quetta, the provincial capital of the southwestern province of Balochistan, at 9am (04:00 GMT) for Peshawar, the capital of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, came under attack near Sibi city, about 160km (100 miles) from Quetta, at around 1pm (08:00 GMT).
The train’s route makes a journey of more than 1,600km (994 miles) through Punjab to reach its final destination, Peshawar. The trip takes roughly 30 hours, with stops at about 30 stations across the country.
On Wednesday night, Pakistan’s security forces said they had concluded a military operation against the fighters, rescuing 346 passengers, and killing all 33 of the attackers. But 26 passengers, the train driver and a paramilitary soldier were also killed, they said.

There were nearly 400 passengers on the train when it was attacked. The BLA, which said it was holding the passengers hostage, had on Tuesday given the Pakistan government a 48-hour ultimatum, demanding the “unconditional release of Baloch political prisoners, forcibly disappeared persons and national resistance activists”.

‘They just took people aside and shot them’
Passengers who have been freed in the security forces’ operation described their hours of captivity as “horrific”.
“I saw so many killings in front of my eyes and I knew that I was the next, but I escaped with other passengers and colleagues on Wednesday morning,” Ghulam Sarwar, 48, told Al Jazeera.
An assistant subinspector of the Pakistan Railways Police, he was onboard the train and later made a daring escape with a group of passengers and fellow armed guards.
Sarwar was travelling on the train from Quetta railway station along with four other armed railway personnel and five soldiers who were charged with guarding the passengers, a regular practice. When the attack began, he said he and the other armed personnel returned fire.
“It was like a rain of rockets and bullets on the train, but we retaliated with gunfire,” he recalled. “When we ran out of bullets, they came down and started pulling the passengers from the train.”

The attackers began separating the passengers according to ethnicity by checking their identity cards, removing ethnic Punjabi passengers and those suspected of being part of the Pakistani military, and executing them. “They killed so many people,” Sarwar said. He could not count how many people were slain, he said, but he witnessed the fighters “just taking groups of people aside from the railway track and shooting them”.
“The killings continued until 10pm after a large number of attackers left the area after hugging some remaining fighters who stayed behind. They also killed anyone who attempted to escape,” Sarwar said.

In the morning, Sarwar and another group of passengers and security personnel managed to escape from the site where the hostages were being held. “We ran out in the morning but another railway policeman who was with me was hit by a bullet on his back after the attackers started shooting at us from the near mountains,” he said. The policeman was killed, he said.
As he and his fellow passengers fled, they were fired upon by the separatist fighters but managed to make it 6km (4 miles) along the tracks to the nearby railway station at Panir, where Pakistani security forces were waiting to receive them.

‘I saw a rocket hit the engine’
Murad Ali, 68, who was travelling to the southern city of Jacobabad with his wife, also witnessed the attack but was among those allowed to go free by the attackers. “I saw a rocket hit the engine of the train after we heard intense firing. They came inside our compartment and asked my identity and ethnicity [Sindhi] and then allowed me to go,” he said.
“I accompanied dozens of women and children and we followed the railway track for six kilometres on foot until we reached the Panir railway station after dusk where security forces took us to Mach railway station,” he told Al Jazeera. The couple then returned to Quetta.
Bibi Farzana, Murad’s wife, described the train as being “entirely covered with smoke due to firing and explosions”. She added: “They pulled off all the passengers but they separated ethnic Punjabis from the rest of the passengers.”

On Wednesday, Pakistan’s security officials said its forces had killed 30 fighters in the operation to rescue the hostages and that security clearance was still going on.
Balochistan province’s Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said the attack was an attempt by separatists to give the impression that Quetta is a “violent environment”.
The government said it had deployed additional soldiers to Quetta railway station, and dozens of coffins have been dispatched to the attack site aboard a relief train from Quetta station.

Baloch separatists, who demand independence from Pakistan, accuse the state of abducting and persecuting those who speak out against it.
While this is the first time a whole train has been hijacked, there have been a series of attacks on trains in the past two years.
Most recently, in November 2024, separatists killed nearly 30 train passengers – most of them Pakistani soldiers – in a suicide bombing at Quetta station as the Jaffar Express was about to depart the station.

Watch: Will arrest of Gaza protester impact campus protests?
Hundreds have taken to the streets in New York City to call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate who was arrested for his role in last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests.
Mr Khalil was detained over the weekend, prompting criticism of the Trump administration and its efforts to deport him.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has accused the former student of "leading activities aligned to Hamas", but provided no details.
The BBC's Nada Tawfik explains what this could mean for campus protests.

An oil tanker and a cargo ship have collided off eastern England, setting both vessels on fire and prompting a rescue operation that has brought at least 32 casualties onshore.
A spokesperson for the United Kingdom’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency said Monday’s crash had occurred off the county of East Yorkshire.

Both the oil tanker and cargo vessel were on fire off the northeastern coast of England with British media showing images of a huge plume of black smoke and flames rising from the scene.
Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, said at least 32 casualties were brought ashore, but their conditions were not immediately clear.
“It’s too far out for us to see – about 10 miles [16km] – but we have seen the vessels bringing them in,” he said, reporting that 13 casualties were brought in on a Windcat 33 vessel, followed by another 19 on a harbour pilot boat.
Boyers said he had been told there was “a massive fireball”.
The coastguard agency sent a helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, lifeboats and vessels with fire-fighting capability to the busy stretch of waterway after the alarm was raised at 09:48 GMT.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which was working on the emergency response, said there were reports that “a number of people had abandoned the vessels”, which sparked “fires on both ships”.
It said three lifeboats were working on search and rescue at the scene alongside the coastguard.
Swedish tanker company Stena Bulk confirmed it owned the oil tanker involved in the accident, specifying that it was operated by Crowley, a United States-based maritime company.

Stena Bulk said the 20-person crew on board had been accounted for.
According to media reports, the cargo ship involved is named the Solong or So Long and is owned by the German company Reederei Koepping.
The area where the collision took place has traffic running from the ports along Britain’s northeast coast to the Netherlands and Germany.
The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations shipping agency, said it was aware of the situation and was checking further.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX has delayed a mission to replace two astronauts stuck on board the International Space Station (ISS) following a last-minute technical glitch.
The postponement of the launch on Wednesday means that NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will have to wait at least two more days before they can begin their return to Earth.

Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June for a mission that was supposed to last 10 days at most, but the pair were forced to extend their stay after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft developed propulsion issues.
Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to return to Earth on board a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft currently docked at the ISS once a team of American, Japanese and Russian astronauts arrives to take their place.
NASA said in a statement that Wednesday’s launch at the Kennedy Space Center was scrubbed due to a hydraulic system issue with a ground support clamp arm for the Falcon 9 rocket.
The space agency said it was working to address the hydraulic system issue and planned to reattempt the launch on Friday.

The Crew-10 team consists of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov.
If the mission goes ahead on Friday, Wilmore and Williams could depart the ISS by March 19, according to NASA.
In a call with reporters earlier this month, Williams said she was looking forward to reuniting with her family.
“It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” Williams said. “We’re here, we have a mission – we’re just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we’re up in space and it’s a lot of fun.”

British Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced that NHS England would be scrapped in order to cut back on bureaucracy.
The announcement comes as the country's National Health Service (NHS), which provides free health care to almost the whole population, increasingly comes under fire for long waiting lists and a number of medical scandals.

What did Starmer say?
"Overstretched, unfocused, trying to do too much, doing it badly," Starmer said while on a visit to the eastern English city of Hull.
"I can't in all honesty explain to the British people why they should spend their money on two layers of bureaucracy. That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations, GP appointments," he said.
"So today, I can announce we're going to cut bureaucracy ... focus government on the priorities of working people, shift money to the front line."
"So I'm bringing management of the NHS back into democratic control by abolishing the arms-length body, NHS England."

Australian police have confirmed that a surfer who went missing was “taken by a shark” after search and rescue teams recovered a surfboard scarred with “bite marks” from the area of the attack.
The victim – identified by Australian media as 37-year-old Steven Payne – was mauled by a shark while surfing at Wharton beach in a remote area of Western Australia, police said late on Tuesday.

It marks Australia’s fourth reported fatal shark attack in recent months.
“I can confirm that our search is a recovery, not a rescue,” Western Australia Police Force Senior Sergeant Christopher Taylor said, noting that the surfer’s body has not been recovered.
“A surfboard with evidence of bite marks was recovered from the water,” Western Australia Police said in a separate statement on Tuesday.
According to media reports, a shark was spotted just moments before the attack in the water off Wharton beach and screams were heard coming from the area where the man was surfing at about midday.
Australia’s 7News network said the victim was in chest-deep water about 50 metres (164 feet) from the shore with two other surfers when he was attacked. Police said the other surfers were unable to do anything to help.

In February, a shark killed a 17-year-old girl swimming off an eastern Australian island, while a 28-year-old surfer was fatally bitten in South Australia a month earlier.
On December 28, a shark fatally bit a 40-year-old man in the neck as he was spearfishing off Queensland.

Watch: Aerial video shows extent of damage to North Sea oil tanker
Aerial video shows the extent of the damage to the US-registered Stena Immaculate oil tanker, almost 24 hours after it collided with a Portuguese-flagged container ship called the Solong.
The incident took place just off the coast of East Yorkshire. Both ships caught fire after the crash at about 10:00 GMT.
The coastguard said 36 people were brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalised.
Solong's owner, Ernst Russ, later shared that one member of its 14-strong crew was missing.

An oil tanker and a cargo ship have collided off eastern England, setting both vessels on fire and prompting a rescue operation that has brought at least 32 casualties onshore.
A spokesperson for the United Kingdom’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency said Monday’s crash had occurred off the county of East Yorkshire.

Both the oil tanker and cargo vessel were on fire off the northeastern coast of England with British media showing images of a huge plume of black smoke and flames rising from the scene.
Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, said at least 32 casualties were brought ashore, but their conditions were not immediately clear.
“It’s too far out for us to see – about 10 miles [16km] – but we have seen the vessels bringing them in,” he said, reporting that 13 casualties were brought in on a Windcat 33 vessel, followed by another 19 on a harbour pilot boat.
Boyers said he had been told there was “a massive fireball”.
The coastguard agency sent a helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, lifeboats and vessels with fire-fighting capability to the busy stretch of waterway after the alarm was raised at 09:48 GMT.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which was working on the emergency response, said there were reports that “a number of people had abandoned the vessels”, which sparked “fires on both ships”.
It said three lifeboats were working on search and rescue at the scene alongside the coastguard.
Swedish tanker company Stena Bulk confirmed it owned the oil tanker involved in the accident, specifying that it was operated by Crowley, a United States-based maritime company.

Stena Bulk said the 20-person crew on board had been accounted for.
According to media reports, the cargo ship involved is named the Solong or So Long and is owned by the German company Reederei Koepping.
The area where the collision took place has traffic running from the ports along Britain’s northeast coast to the Netherlands and Germany.
The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations shipping agency, said it was aware of the situation and was checking further.

Watch: Will arrest of Gaza protester impact campus protests?
Hundreds have taken to the streets in New York City to call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate who was arrested for his role in last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests.
Mr Khalil was detained over the weekend, prompting criticism of the Trump administration and its efforts to deport him.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has accused the former student of "leading activities aligned to Hamas", but provided no details.
The BBC's Nada Tawfik explains what this could mean for campus protests.

Australian police have confirmed that a surfer who went missing was “taken by a shark” after search and rescue teams recovered a surfboard scarred with “bite marks” from the area of the attack.
The victim – identified by Australian media as 37-year-old Steven Payne – was mauled by a shark while surfing at Wharton beach in a remote area of Western Australia, police said late on Tuesday.

It marks Australia’s fourth reported fatal shark attack in recent months.
“I can confirm that our search is a recovery, not a rescue,” Western Australia Police Force Senior Sergeant Christopher Taylor said, noting that the surfer’s body has not been recovered.
“A surfboard with evidence of bite marks was recovered from the water,” Western Australia Police said in a separate statement on Tuesday.
According to media reports, a shark was spotted just moments before the attack in the water off Wharton beach and screams were heard coming from the area where the man was surfing at about midday.
Australia’s 7News network said the victim was in chest-deep water about 50 metres (164 feet) from the shore with two other surfers when he was attacked. Police said the other surfers were unable to do anything to help.

In February, a shark killed a 17-year-old girl swimming off an eastern Australian island, while a 28-year-old surfer was fatally bitten in South Australia a month earlier.
On December 28, a shark fatally bit a 40-year-old man in the neck as he was spearfishing off Queensland.

Watch: Aerial video shows extent of damage to North Sea oil tanker
Aerial video shows the extent of the damage to the US-registered Stena Immaculate oil tanker, almost 24 hours after it collided with a Portuguese-flagged container ship called the Solong.
The incident took place just off the coast of East Yorkshire. Both ships caught fire after the crash at about 10:00 GMT.
The coastguard said 36 people were brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalised.
Solong's owner, Ernst Russ, later shared that one member of its 14-strong crew was missing.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX has delayed a mission to replace two astronauts stuck on board the International Space Station (ISS) following a last-minute technical glitch.
The postponement of the launch on Wednesday means that NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will have to wait at least two more days before they can begin their return to Earth.

Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June for a mission that was supposed to last 10 days at most, but the pair were forced to extend their stay after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft developed propulsion issues.
Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to return to Earth on board a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft currently docked at the ISS once a team of American, Japanese and Russian astronauts arrives to take their place.
NASA said in a statement that Wednesday’s launch at the Kennedy Space Center was scrubbed due to a hydraulic system issue with a ground support clamp arm for the Falcon 9 rocket.
The space agency said it was working to address the hydraulic system issue and planned to reattempt the launch on Friday.

The Crew-10 team consists of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov.
If the mission goes ahead on Friday, Wilmore and Williams could depart the ISS by March 19, according to NASA.
In a call with reporters earlier this month, Williams said she was looking forward to reuniting with her family.
“It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” Williams said. “We’re here, we have a mission – we’re just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we’re up in space and it’s a lot of fun.”

An oil tanker and a cargo ship have collided off eastern England, setting both vessels on fire and prompting a rescue operation that has brought at least 32 casualties onshore.
A spokesperson for the United Kingdom’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency said Monday’s crash had occurred off the county of East Yorkshire.

Both the oil tanker and cargo vessel were on fire off the northeastern coast of England with British media showing images of a huge plume of black smoke and flames rising from the scene.
Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, said at least 32 casualties were brought ashore, but their conditions were not immediately clear.
“It’s too far out for us to see – about 10 miles [16km] – but we have seen the vessels bringing them in,” he said, reporting that 13 casualties were brought in on a Windcat 33 vessel, followed by another 19 on a harbour pilot boat.
Boyers said he had been told there was “a massive fireball”.
The coastguard agency sent a helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, lifeboats and vessels with fire-fighting capability to the busy stretch of waterway after the alarm was raised at 09:48 GMT.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which was working on the emergency response, said there were reports that “a number of people had abandoned the vessels”, which sparked “fires on both ships”.
It said three lifeboats were working on search and rescue at the scene alongside the coastguard.
Swedish tanker company Stena Bulk confirmed it owned the oil tanker involved in the accident, specifying that it was operated by Crowley, a United States-based maritime company.

Stena Bulk said the 20-person crew on board had been accounted for.
According to media reports, the cargo ship involved is named the Solong or So Long and is owned by the German company Reederei Koepping.
The area where the collision took place has traffic running from the ports along Britain’s northeast coast to the Netherlands and Germany.
The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations shipping agency, said it was aware of the situation and was checking further.

Watch: Will arrest of Gaza protester impact campus protests?
Hundreds have taken to the streets in New York City to call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate who was arrested for his role in last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests.
Mr Khalil was detained over the weekend, prompting criticism of the Trump administration and its efforts to deport him.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has accused the former student of "leading activities aligned to Hamas", but provided no details.
The BBC's Nada Tawfik explains what this could mean for campus protests.

Australian police have confirmed that a surfer who went missing was “taken by a shark” after search and rescue teams recovered a surfboard scarred with “bite marks” from the area of the attack.
The victim – identified by Australian media as 37-year-old Steven Payne – was mauled by a shark while surfing at Wharton beach in a remote area of Western Australia, police said late on Tuesday.

It marks Australia’s fourth reported fatal shark attack in recent months.
“I can confirm that our search is a recovery, not a rescue,” Western Australia Police Force Senior Sergeant Christopher Taylor said, noting that the surfer’s body has not been recovered.
“A surfboard with evidence of bite marks was recovered from the water,” Western Australia Police said in a separate statement on Tuesday.
According to media reports, a shark was spotted just moments before the attack in the water off Wharton beach and screams were heard coming from the area where the man was surfing at about midday.
Australia’s 7News network said the victim was in chest-deep water about 50 metres (164 feet) from the shore with two other surfers when he was attacked. Police said the other surfers were unable to do anything to help.

In February, a shark killed a 17-year-old girl swimming off an eastern Australian island, while a 28-year-old surfer was fatally bitten in South Australia a month earlier.
On December 28, a shark fatally bit a 40-year-old man in the neck as he was spearfishing off Queensland.

Watch: Aerial video shows extent of damage to North Sea oil tanker
Aerial video shows the extent of the damage to the US-registered Stena Immaculate oil tanker, almost 24 hours after it collided with a Portuguese-flagged container ship called the Solong.
The incident took place just off the coast of East Yorkshire. Both ships caught fire after the crash at about 10:00 GMT.
The coastguard said 36 people were brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalised.
Solong's owner, Ernst Russ, later shared that one member of its 14-strong crew was missing.
