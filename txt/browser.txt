Russia reported that dozens of drones were launched at Moscow on Tuesday, referring to it as an "enemy" attack, a term they often use for Ukraine. The attack occurred hours before crucial talks between US and Ukrainian officials. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest drone attacks on Moscow since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russian officials stated that one person was killed and three were wounded in the Moscow region after at least 69 drones were destroyed while flying toward the city. Falling debris damaged buildings, and two Moscow airports, as well as two airports east of the city, were temporarily closed for safety reasons.

The reported attacks come ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia between United States and Ukrainian delegations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security adviser Mike Waltz are scheduled to meet with Ukrainian national security advisor, foreign minister, and defense minister.

Rubio indicated that the US wants to hear what concessions Ukraine is willing to make in negotiations to end the war with Russia. These talks could determine whether Washington resumes providing military aid and full intelligence sharing with Kyiv.

Fighting on the ground has intensified recently, coinciding with a strained US-Ukraine relationship. Russia launched a major aerial assault on Ukraine last Friday and Saturday, resulting in more than two dozen deaths, with additional attacks killing six more civilians from Sunday to Monday. Ukraine’s presence in Russia’s Kursk region is also shrinking sharply.

Ukraine’s reported attack on Moscow Tuesday appeared to be larger than its previous largest assault on the Russian capital last November, when Russia said it downed 34 Ukrainian drones during that attack, which injured a woman, forced the temporary closure of airspace and caused two houses to catch fire.
